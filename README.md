# Vanilla Javascript & TailwindCSS TodoList

The TodoList is a common project course in all languages for the purpose of learning them. 
It's why I realized this lil project to fill my free time by trying out the CSS framework `Tailwind` 
and testing some notions of Javascript.

Note for myself : I forgot to do the function for display when a task is done.
